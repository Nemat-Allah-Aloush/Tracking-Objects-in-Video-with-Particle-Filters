### About the project
This project tackles a real-world computer vision problem. 
The goal of the project is to locate and track a target in a video shot with a digital camera. Moreover, some classic chalanges are encourted with an artificial intelligence technique called a particle filter. Some of the challenges: noisy sensor data, objects that change shape, and occlusion (object hidden from view)
